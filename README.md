A fully customizable and flexible paging menu controller built from other view controllers placed inside a scroll view allowing the user to switch between any kind of view controller with an easy tap or swipe gesture similar to what Spotify, Windows Phone, and Instagram use. This is a RTL-edeted version and it is based on the Objective-C version of <a href="https://github.com/uacaps/PageMenu">PageMenu<a/>.
